**ClansLite**

ClansLite is a light-weight clans plugin for Minecraft servers running Spigot and most of its forks!

ClansLite does not support any grief prevention tools such as land claiming or securing containers within your clan.

ClansLite DOES however offer the ability to disable friendly fire within your clan!
